The ingredients here are different from the ones in the scenes.
In scene are the ingredients with the puzzle mechanics (such as burning)
Those prefabs dont have the puzzle, they are just models
These prefabs get spawned when the ingredient is pulld from the bag
I'm talking about the single ingredientsthe whole plants are the same as those in scene
They have the same name for coding reasons
